CR Weather is a weather web application that shows the current weather for each province in Costa Rica.

It was developed using SCSS to allow greater flexibility in styling logic and Vue.JS to implement reactive components.

The information is obtained through the consumption of an external API which provides climate information based on each country. Said API is consumed by the Axios implementation for the respective Vue components.
